1. **Clone and setup:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd covenantrix-v2
   
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

   ```

## 📖 Usage

### Process Documents

```bash
# Process single document
python main.py --process path/to/contract.pdf

# Process multiple documents
python main.py --process doc1.pdf doc2.docx doc3.txt --folder "client-abc"
```

### Interactive Querying

```bash
# Start interactive session
python main.py --interactive
```

Example session:
```
[legal_advisor|hybrid] Query: What are the main obligations of each party?

🔍 Processing query...

📝 Response (Confidence: 0.87):
Based on the contract analysis, the main obligations are:

1. **Party A (Service Provider) Obligations:**
   - Deliver services according to specifications in Section 3.1
   - Maintain confidentiality as outlined in Section 7
   - Provide monthly progress reports (Section 4.2)

2. **Party B (Client) Obligations:**
   - Pay fees according to Schedule A
   - Provide necessary access and materials (Section 2.3)
   - Review and approve deliverables within 5 business days

💡 Suggested follow-up questions:
   1. What are the consequences of failing to meet these obligations?
   2. Are there any penalty clauses for non-performance?
   3. How are disputes regarding obligations resolved?
```

### Single Query

```bash
# Execute single query with specific persona
python main.py --query "Identify legal risks in this contract" --persona risk_assessor --mode global
```

### Batch Testing

Create a test file `tests.json`:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "Contract Analysis Test",
    "query": "What are the key terms and conditions?",
    "persona": "contract_analyst",
    "mode": "hybrid"
  },
  {
    "name": "Risk Assessment Test",
    "query": "What legal risks should I be concerned about?",
    "persona": "risk_assessor",
    "mode": "global"
  }
]
```

Run tests:
```bash
python main.py --test tests.json
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'lightrag'"**
```bash
pip install lightrag-hku
```

**2. "OpenAI API key not found"**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
# Or add to .env file
```

**3. "Tesseract not found" (for image OCR)**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr

# macOS
brew install tesseract

# Windows
# Download from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
```

**4. Memory issues with large documents**
- Reduce `chunk_token_size` in config.yaml
- Process documents individually rather than in batches
- Increase system RAM or use cloud instance
